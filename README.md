# Nabil-Said-Data-Analyst-Portfolio

# About

My name is Nabil.
With a background in biology, I specialize in data analysis applied to public health. I have worked on epidemiological projects, leveraging Python, Excel, and NLP tools (such as scispaCy) to extract and analyze biomedical data.
Passionate about data, I am eager to apply my skills to projects with a meaningful social impact.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
